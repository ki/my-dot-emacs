Feel free to email me at kirubakaran+my-dot-emacs@gmail.com 
I am eager to hear from you.

I am intentionally leaving things minimal. I'll add better documentation / code based on your input. Right now I don't know what is lacking. Help me by telling me what you did not understand etc.

Purpose
-------

1. Help new emacs users have a well configured emacs environment right away.
2. Help new emacs users explore each section, learning in the process. So the file is filled with comments and URLs

Steps
-----

1. Install emacs
2. Check out this project using git and copy my-dot-emacs.txt to your home folder (referred to as ~) and call it .emacs
3. Create ~/emacs/
4. Download the required .el files into ~/emacs/ (listed in the next section)
5. Install required applications (listed in the next section)

TODO
====
* There are many paths and references that are specific to my machines. I need to abstract these away.
